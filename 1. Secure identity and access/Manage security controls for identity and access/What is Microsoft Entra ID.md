# Microsoft Entra ID Overview

## Introduction

Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management service that enables employees to access external resources such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications. It also facilitates access to internal resources like applications on a corporate intranet and custom cloud applications developed for an organization.

## Who Uses Microsoft Entra ID?

- **IT Administrators**: Utilize Microsoft Entra ID to control access to applications and resources based on business requirements. Features include enforcing multifactor authentication (MFA), automating user provisioning between on-premises Active Directory and cloud applications, and protecting user identities and credentials.

- **Application Developers**: Leverage Microsoft Entra ID as a standards-based authentication provider to add single sign-on (SSO) capabilities to applications, allowing users to authenticate using existing credentials. Developers can also use Microsoft Entra APIs to build personalized experiences using organizational data.

- **Microsoft Online Service Subscribers**: Users of services like Microsoft 365, Office 365, Azure, or Dynamics CRM Online automatically have a Microsoft Entra tenant, enabling immediate management of access to integrated cloud applications.
