# Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark: Identity Management and Privileged Access

## IM-1: Use centralized identity and authentication system

**Security Principle:**
- Centralize identity and authentication management.

**Azure Guidance:**
- Use Microsoft Entra ID to centralize identity and authentication.
- Avoid on-premises authentication methods.
- Migrate on-premises apps to Microsoft Entra ID whenever possible.

**Azure Implementation:**
- Set up a Microsoft Entra ID instance.
- Sync with on-premises Active Directory.

## IM-2: Protect identity and authentication systems

**Security Principle:**
- Secure identity and authentication systems as a high priority.

**Azure Guidance:**
- Use Identity Secure Score to evaluate and improve security.
- Implement limited administrative roles.
- Enforce MFA and block legacy authentication.

**Key Tools:**
- Microsoft Entra ID Identity Protection.
- Microsoft Defender for Identity.

## IM-3: Manage application identities securely and automatically

**Security Principle:**
- Securely and automatically manage application identities.

**Azure Guidance:**
- Use managed identities to avoid hardcoded credentials.
- If needed, use service principals with restricted permissions.

**Azure Implementation:**
- Use managed identities for Azure resources.
- Configure service principals.

## IM-4: Authenticate server and services

**Security Principle:**
- Ensure secure authentication between clients and remote servers.

**Azure Guidance:**
- Use TLS for server authentication.
- Apps must validate certificates during handshake.

**Azure Services:**
- API Management, API Gateway (mutual auth supported).

## IM-5: Use single sign-on (SSO) for application access

**Security Principle:**
- Simplify user experience with single sign-on (SSO).

**Azure Guidance:**
- Use Microsoft Entra ID SSO for corporate and third-party apps.

**Azure Implementation:**
- Configure SSO with Microsoft Entra ID.

## IM-6: Use strong authentication controls

**Security Principle:**
- Require strong authentication (passwordless or MFA) for all access.

**Azure Guidance:**
- Prefer passwordless methods: Windows Hello, Microsoft Authenticator, FIDO2.
- Enforce MFA, especially for admins.
- Avoid legacy auth; follow best practices if unavoidable.

**Azure Implementation:**
- Enable MFA in Azure.
- Use available passwordless methods.

## IM-7: Restrict resource access based on conditions

**Security Principle:**
- Validate access conditions using a zero-trust model.

**Azure Guidance:**
- Use Conditional Access in Microsoft Entra ID for granular control.
- Apply risk/location/device-based policies.

**Common Conditional Access Scenarios:**
- Require MFA for admins.
- Block legacy auth.
- Limit access to trusted locations.

**Azure Implementation:**
- Set Conditional Access policies in Azure portal.
